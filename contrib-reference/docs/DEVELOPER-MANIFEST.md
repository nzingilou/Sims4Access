# Developer manifest

Base: upstream adb868c. CHANGES.patch contains the remaining local differences.

- Scripts/tyjokr_a11y_extensions.py: one queued startup for remaining local helpers. Old contrib/settings bootstrap modules and duplicate wall/layer/surface sources are removed.
- Scripts/tyjokr_a11y_layers.py, grid.py and place.py: attached-content focus and explicit surface targeting use native slot validation and the original placement/payment transaction.
- Scripts/tyjokr_a11y_rooms.py and room_bridge.py: custom labels take priority over cached inferred Plus room names; the bridge no longer patches grid functions.
- Scripts/tyjokr_a11y_settings.py and menu.py: chair-hint toggle and legacy-key migration alongside upstream settings.
- flash/TooltipManager_patched.as: scenario group/card traversal and narration; native apartment-marker focus/activation; rental region/building traversal. Earlier local UI repairs are retained.
- flash/extra-classes/PlexLotSelectOverlay.as: two helpers map the exact native clip to its lot data and call the existing validated selection handler. rebuild_all.ps1 adds this class to the existing GameEntryDock movie.
- Remaining house, basement, coordinate, roof, detached-building, lot-grid, chair, cleaning, away-action and event-goal modules retain their individual source files and tests.

- Native chair snapping: Scripts/tyjokr_a11y_chair_snap.py selects and revalidates native seat slots; grid.py (_fit_parts, _build_place) dispatches preview/placement; place.py (place, _finish, _after_payment) verifies attachment before payment. settings.py/menu.py expose the independent experimental toggle. chair_alignment.py suppresses duplicate hints. tools/test_chair_snapping.py covers 23 transaction and targeting cases.
